# dotfiles to instantly turbo-boost your productivity on MacOS ðŸš€

## This is a WIP project.
## The end-goals of this project are:
- ### An automatic script to install all my favorite ZSH plugins (using oh-my-zsh). 
     - For folks familiar with oh-my-zsh plugins, you can install the plugins in this zshrc file and also, copy (and modify) keybindings at the bottom to your own zshrc. 
     - My favorite plugins
- ### A comprehensive set of aliases in the file that saves you from writing long commands that don't need to be long. Why `git rebase -i` when you can `grbi`? 
  - NOTE: The git oh-my-zsh plugin provides a long list of git aliases which can be found here, so those are no included in the aliases file
- ### An awesome Hammerspoon config

- Extend []() and add key bindings to enable and disable tabbed windows for the same application
